# <a id="top"></a> My Personal Portfolio Project
## www.rowdyrich.com

My personal portfolio is a snapshot into my design sense and coding skills. The portfolio should not be a comprehensive view of everything I have to offer, but should show different avenues an interested party could pursue in discussion with me.

For my design I went with a barebones structures using a combination of colours inspired by afro-futuristic science fiction designs. I have been heavily influenced by comic book art with an emphasis on the strong lines and bright colours used in Image & Marvel comics in the late 2000's.

My Pintrest mood board is made up of images that I dound through looking up Afro-Futurism and then recommendations made by Pintrest based on my saved images.
