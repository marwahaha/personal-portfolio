# <a id="top"></a> My Personal Portfolio Project
## www.rowdyrich.com

My personal portfolio is a snapshot into my design sense and coding skills. The portfolio should not be a comprehensive view of everything I have to offer, but should show different avenues an interested party could pursue in discussion with me.

For my design I went with a barebones structures using a combination of colours inspired by afro-futuristic science fiction designs. I have been heavily influenced by comic book art with an emphasis on the strong lines and bright colours used in Image & Marvel comics in the late 2000's.

My Pintrest mood board is made up of images that I dound through looking up Afro-Futurism and then recommendations made by Pintrest based on my saved images.

# <a id="MVP"></a>Minimum Viable Product
My MVP is a basic website using the Afro-Futurism colour scheme. It is designed to be a supplement for my CV so that employers can find me and easily contact me.

## Tagline
My tagline is "I’m a great believer in luck, and I find the harder I work the more I have of it.” which is a quote by Thomas Jefferson. I also considered "Take time to deliberate; but when the time for action arrives, stop thinking and go in." I am a history buff and wanted to include something related to this in my portfolio.

## Ian Enders
My primary inspiration for my website was the personal portfolio of Ian Enders. It is a simple, one page design that really catches the eye when you see it. It uses limited content to have more impact with the content available.

## Typography
My Typography was randomly selected from Google fonts on a whim. I wanted a font that was modern and simple.

I used Figma to do my design and finalise my layout.
